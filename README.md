## Introduction

As a hands on Assignment, you will be working on a real world dataset provided by the Chicago Data Portal. Imagine, you have been hired by a non-profit organization that strives to improve educational outcomes for children and youth in the City of Chicago. Your job is to analyze the census, crime, and school data for a given neighborhood or district. You will identify causes that impact the enrollment, safety, health, environment ratings of schools.

You will be asked questions that will help you understand the data just like a data analyst or data scientist would. You will be assessed both on the correctness of your SQL queries and results.
